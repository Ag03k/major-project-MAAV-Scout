# Urban Traffic Planning Analysis and Route Optimization
[![IEEE Xplore](https://img.shields.io/badge/Published%20in-IEEE%20Xplore-blue)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10760953)

## 📌 Overview

**Urban Traffic Planning Analysis and Route Optimization** is a capstone project addressing the growing issue of urban traffic congestion. This system proposes a smart web-based application that suggests optimal routes by combining multi-point route optimization, 
real-time traffic analysis, and predictive modeling. Unlike conventional tools like Google Maps, it prioritizes **time-based efficiency** over static distance-based routing.

## 💡 Key Features

- 🔀 **Multi-point Route Optimization**: Finds the most efficient route for multiple destinations.
- 🚦 **Real-time Traffic Integration**: Adapts routes based on current conditions.
- 📈 **Predictive Modeling**: Uses historical traffic data for proactive suggestions.
- 🗺️ **Visual Route Planning**: Interactive map-based UI for route visualization.
- ⚙️ **Custom Algorithm Engine**: Hybrid A* and Dijkstra algorithm implementation.
